      <h1>PC Hardware</h1>
      <div id="pDiv">
        <p>My Junior year of High School built my first gaming PC.  Since then I have built computers for many of my friends and have helped many people fix issues with their computers.  This interest in computers eventually led to me my interest in software engineering.</p>

      <h2>Basketball</h2>
      <div id="pDiv">
        <p>Starting in Middle School I began to develop an interest in basketball.  Starting in high school I began to watch multiple basjetball games daily.  I wanted to understand as much as I could about the game.  Eventually I started playing fantasy basketball which increased my interest in the game to an even higher level.</p>

      <h3>Anime And Manga</h3>
      <div id="pDiv2">
        <p>During the Covid lockdown I began to watch Anime and Manga.  These mediums allow for stories that wouldn't be able to be told in live action.  While these stories seem basic on the surface they are able to delve into many themes such as discrimination, revenge,and how having a support system around you influences your life.</p>

      <h4>Video Games</h4>
      <div id="pDiv2">
        <p>I have been playing video games as long as I can remember. This hobby allowed for me to develop my social skills and made me interested in PC gaming and subsequently computer science.</p>
